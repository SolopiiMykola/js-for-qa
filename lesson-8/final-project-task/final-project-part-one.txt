You need to setup your own project and rewrite existing registration-page.js 
tests in testcafe-project folder using Page Object pattern
Your project structure should follow next format:

    src 
        data - folder which contains your test  (optional)
        pages
            base-page.js            - This file should contain base method with the same for each pages, for example `navigateToUrl()`
            registration-page.js    - This files should contain Class where you extends from your Base Class
                                       In following class you should put all elements which exist in registration tests
                                       Also this class should contain methods which related to this page, for example - `registerNewUser(someData) {}`
        tests
            registration-po-test.js - Yor page object implementation test file. 
                                      This file should import methods from your registration-page.js
    package.json -- should contains all neccessary packages
