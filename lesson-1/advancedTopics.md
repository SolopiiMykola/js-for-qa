### "let" variable

### "const" variable

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const

let  and const  basically replace var . You use let  instead of var  and const  instead of var  if you plan on never re-assigning this "variable" (effectively turning it into a constant therefore).
