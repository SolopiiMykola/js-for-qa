In real-life, browser modules are rarely used in 
their “raw” form. Usually, we bundle them together 
with a special tool such as Webpack/Babel and deploy to 
the production server.
A module is a file. To make import/export work, 
browsers need <script type="module"></script>

<!doctype html>
<script type="module">
  import {add} from './data.js';

  document.body.innerHTML = add(1, 2);
</script>
