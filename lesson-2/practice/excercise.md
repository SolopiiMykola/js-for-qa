1) Rewrite if with ?

let result;
if (a + b < 10) {
  result = 'Few';
} else {
  result = 'Many';
}

2) Write an if condition to verify that the age variable is between 18 and 90 inclusive.
Inclusive means that the value of age can be either 18 or 90.

3) I recommend you to run code in browser console, since it allows easy usage of user input parsing with prompt method.

prompt() // Use to get input from user if needed
alert() // To output with alert

Log available everywhere (browser or nodejs):
console.log()

3. Write script that will 
- accept user name
- welcome user with his username
- ask his birthday year
- calculate how old is user, and print (or alert) his calculated age

Example:
-> Please, enter your first name
<- Mykola
-> Hello, Mykola, nice to meet you. -> Please enter your birthday year
<- 1900
-> 119 years


4. Write a script which will convert number into corresponding letter, and print(or alert) result:

The grades should be computed as follows :
Range Grade
<60 F
<70 D
<80 C
<90 B
<100 A

Example:
for number 92 - print "A"
for number 29 - print "F"
